# hdm: High-Dimensional Metrics

Implementation of selected high-dimensional statistical and econometric methods for estimation and inference. Efficient estimators and uniformly valid confidence intervals for various low-dimensional causal/ structural parameters are provided which appear in high-dimensional approximately sparse models. Including functions for fitting heteroscedastic robust Lasso regressions with non-Gaussian errors and for instrumental variable (IV) and treatment effect estimation in a high-dimensional setting. Moreover, the methods enable valid post-selection inference and rely on a theoretically grounded, data-driven choice of the penalty.
